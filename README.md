![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/HridoyG/otp-code-generator-and-validator?style=flat-square)

Welcome to the **OTP Code Generator and Validator** repository! This project enables you to generate and validate time-based One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for multi-factor authentication (MFA). The purpose of this tool is to enhance security in various applications by providing a reliable method for user verification.

## Features

- **Time-Based OTP Generation**: Create OTPs that are valid for a short period.
- **Validation**: Check the validity of generated OTPs.
- **Secure**: Utilizes HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for security.
- **Device Compatibility**: Works on various devices and platforms.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for developers to use in their applications.

## Installation

To get started with the OTP Code Generator and Validator, you need to clone this repository. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HridoyG/otp-code-generator-and-validator.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd otp-code-generator-and-validator
```

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use the following command to install them:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To generate and validate OTPs, you can follow the examples provided in the documentation. For detailed instructions, please refer to the examples section below.

### Generate OTP

To generate a time-based OTP, use the following function:

```javascript
const otp = generateOTP(secret);
console.log(`Your OTP is: ${otp}`);
```

### Validate OTP

To validate an OTP, use the following function:

```javascript
const isValid = validateOTP(secret, userInput);
console.log(`Is the OTP valid? ${isValid}`);
```

## How It Works

The OTP generator uses the TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) algorithm. This algorithm combines a shared secret key and the current time to produce a unique OTP. The OTP changes every 30 seconds, ensuring that even if an OTP is intercepted, it becomes useless after a short time.

1. **Secret Key**: A unique key shared between the server and the client.
2. **Current Time**: The current timestamp is divided into intervals (usually 30 seconds).
3. **HMAC**: The secret key and the current interval are combined using HMAC to produce the OTP.

This process ensures that each OTP is unique and time-sensitive, providing a secure method for user authentication.

## Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to generate and validate an OTP:

```javascript
const secret = 'your-unique-secret-key';

// Generate OTP
const otp = generateOTP(secret);
console.log(`Generated OTP: ${otp}`);

// User input
const userInput = prompt('Enter the OTP: ');

// Validate OTP
const isValid = validateOTP(secret, userInput);
console.log(`Is the OTP valid? ${isValid}`);
```

This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the OTP generator and validator. You can expand on this by integrating it into your applications.
